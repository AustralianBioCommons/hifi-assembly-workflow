## About

HiFi-assembly-workflow is a bioinformatics pipeline that can be used to analyse Pacbio CCS reads for *de novo* genome assembly using PacBio Circular Consensus Sequencing (CCS) reads. This workflow is implemented in Nextflow and has 3 major sections. 
 
Please refer to [this documentation for a detailed description](recommendations) of each workflow section:
 
- Adapter filtration and pre-assembly quality control (QC)
- Assembly
- Post-assembly QC


## Please cite the workflow as follows
