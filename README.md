# HiFi *de novo* genome assembly workflow

HiFi-assembly-workflow is a bioinformatics pipeline that can be used to analyse Pacbio CCS reads for *de novo* genome assembly using PacBio Circular Consensus Sequencing (CCS)  reads. This workflow is implemented in Nextflow and has 3 major sections. 
 
Please refer to the following documentation for detailed description of each workflow section:
 
- [Adapter filtration and pre-assembly quality control (QC)](https://github.com/AusARG/hifi-assembly-workflow/blob/master/recommendations.md#stage-1-adapter-filteration-and-pre-assembly-quality-control)
- [Assembly](https://github.com/AusARG/hifi-assembly-workflow/blob/master/recommendations.md#stage-2-assembly)
- [Post-assembly QC](https://github.com/AusARG/hifi-assembly-workflow/blob/master/recommendations.md#stage-3-post-assembly-quality-control)


## General recommendations 

A more detailed module and workflow description as well as execution examples on Gadi and Setonix are [available here](workflows.md).
